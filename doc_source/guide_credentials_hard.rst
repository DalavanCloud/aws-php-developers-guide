With |IAM| roles for |ECS| tasks, you can specify an |IAM| role that can be
used by the containers in a task. This provides a strategy for managing credentials
for your applications to use, similar to the way that |EC2| instance profiles
provide credentials to EC2 instances.

Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials to the containers or
using the EC2 instanceâ€™s role, you can associate an |IAM| role with an ECS task definition or
``RunTask`` :aws-php-class:`API </api-ecs-2014-11-13.html#runtask>` operation.

.. note::

    Instance profile credentials and other temporary credentials generated by
    the |STS|) are not supported by every
    service. To determine whether the service you are using supports temporary
    credentials, see :iam-ug:`AWS Services that Support AWS STS <reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam>`.

For more information, see :EC2-ug:`IAM Roles for Amazon EC2 Container Service Tasks<task-iam-roles>`.
